# LethalCompanyInsanityMeter
Adds a violet colored insanity bar right above the clock to Lethal Company.

This shows the game's insanity value from the player controller on your HUD.

Ghost Girl uses this value to choose who to haunt.
If you have a higher insanity than everyone else, you are more likely to be chosen.
